## 📝 Overview

This project provides a complete pipeline for:

1. Preprocessing grain images  
2. Extracting handcrafted features (color, texture, shape)  
3. Training machine learning classifiers  
4. Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

It is aimed at enabling accurate and efficient grain quality assessment.
